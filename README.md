# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform
- Embeded videos

## Plan on improving the project

- Looking into the button and animation features could really improve how people interact with the site. Upgraded hover responses would be a good place to start.
